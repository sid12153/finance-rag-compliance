# Problem Statement

Financial institutions and consulting firms regularly analyze public company filings to understand financial, regulatory, and operational risks. These filings are lengthy, unstructured, and often contain overlapping or boilerplate language, making it difficult to quickly identify the most material risks and changes across reporting periods.

The objective of this project is to design a structured analysis workflow that retrieves relevant sections from public filings and supports analyst-style risk assessment in a traceable and evidence-based manner.

Specifically, this project aims to answer the following questions using only information disclosed in source documents:

# Key Analysis Questions

1) What are the primary risk factors disclosed in the company’s most recent annual or quarterly filing, and which risk categories appear most significant?

2) How have the company’s disclosed risks changed compared to previous reporting periods, based on language, emphasis, or newly introduced risk factors?

3) What regulatory or compliance-related risks are highlighted, and how does management describe their potential impact on operations or financial performance?

4) What forward-looking uncertainties or cautionary statements does the company disclose that could materially affect future results?

5) Are there any legal, governance, or regulatory issues disclosed, and what mitigation strategies, if any, are described?

6) How does the company describe exposure to market, credit, or operational risks, and which of these appear most prominent based on disclosure detail?

7) Based solely on disclosed information, which risks should an analyst or investor prioritize monitoring over the next reporting period?
